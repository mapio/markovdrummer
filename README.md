Markov drummer
==============

This is an educational package that explores algorithmic generation of *drum
grooves* using *Markov chains*.

Given a MIDI file containing a drum goorve, one can obtain a Markov chain
modeling the beat and then use such model to generate new (original) beats. It
is also possible to "merge" different chains to obtain a kind of "fusion" of
different grooves.
